3. **During conversation**:
   - UPDATE the SAME artifact after EVERY significant action
   - Use artifact update command, NOT create
   - Preserve all existing content
   - Add new information chronologically
4. **At conversation end**:
   - Save artifact content to GitHub: `InnovareAI/mossy-ventures/docs/handover.md`
   - Commit with message: "Update handover document - [date/time]"

### Update Triggers (MUST update artifact after):
